# Tasks

## Preparation

- [ ] **Step 1 — Sync default branch:** `git checkout <default-branch>` and `git pull --ff-only`
- [ ] **Step 2 — Create and publish working branch:** `git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>` then immediately `git push -u origin <feature-branch-name>`

## Execution

- [ ] Implement sub-tasks in small, testable increments
- [ ] Review for duplication and unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Confirm acceptance criteria are covered

Suggested start-of-work commands: `git checkout <default-branch>` → `git pull --ff-only` → `git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>` → `git push -u origin <feature-branch-name>`

## Validation

- [ ] Run unit/integration tests
- [ ] Run E2E tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Run type checks
- [ ] Run build
- [ ] Run security/code quality checks required by project standards
- [ ] All completed tasks marked as complete
- [ ] All steps in [Remote push validation]

## Remote push validation

Verification requirements (all must pass before PR or pushing updates to a PR):

- **Unit tests** — run the project's unit test suite; all tests must pass
- **Integration tests** — run the project's integration test suite; all tests must pass
- **Regression / E2E tests** — run the project's end-to-end or regression test suite; all tests must pass
- **Build** — run the project's build script; build must succeed with no errors
- if **ANY** of the above fail, you **MUST** iterate and address the failure

Use the project's documented commands for each of the above (see project README or CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md).

## PR and Merge

- [ ] Run the required pre-commit review from `skills/openspec-apply-change/SKILL.md` before committing, ensuring the primary agent automatically addresses all findings from the sub-agent
- [ ] Commit all changes to the working branch and push to remote
- [ ] Open PR from working branch to `<default-branch>`
- [ ] Wait 180 seconds for CI to start and agentic reviewers to post their comments
- [ ] Enable auto-merge: `gh pr merge <PR-URL> --auto --merge`
- [ ] **Iterate until merged** — repeat the following priority loop continuously until `gh pr view <PR-URL> --json state` returns `MERGED`; if it returns `CLOSED` exit and notify the user — **never wait for a human to report the merge; never force-merge**:
  1. **Build and tests** — run all steps in [Remote push validation]; fix any failures, commit, and push before doing anything else in this iteration
  2. **PR comments** — poll for unresolved review threads; for every unresolved thread, address the feedback, commit fixes, run [Remote push validation], push, wait 180 seconds; continue until all threads are resolved
  3. **CI check failures** — only after all comments are resolved, poll for failing required checks; fix each failure, commit, run [Remote push validation], push, wait 180 seconds; then restart this loop from step 1

After every push, restart at step 1. Never skip the build/test gate before pushing any fix.

Blocking resolution flow:

- CI failure → fix → commit → validate locally → push → re-run checks
- Security finding → remediate → commit → validate locally → push → re-scan
- Review comment → address → commit → validate locally → push → confirm resolved

## Post-Merge

- [ ] `git checkout <default-branch>` and `git pull --ff-only`
- [ ] Verify the merged changes appear on the default branch
- [ ] Mark all remaining tasks as complete (`- [x]`)
- [ ] Update repository documentation impacted by the change
- [ ] Sync approved spec deltas into `openspec/specs/` (global spec). After copying each `spec.md` to `openspec/specs/<cap>/spec.md`, update all relative links that pointed into the change directory so they resolve from the archive location — replace `../../design.md` with `../../changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/design.md`, and similarly for `../../tasks.md` and any other relative paths into the change directory.
- [ ] Archive the change: move `openspec/changes/<name>/` to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/` **and stage both the new location and the deletion of the old location in a single commit** — do not commit the copy and delete separately
- [ ] Confirm `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/` exists and `openspec/changes/<name>/` is gone
- [ ] Commit and push the archive to the default branch in one commit
- [ ] Prune merged local feature branches: `git fetch --prune` and `git branch -D <feature-branch>`

Required cleanup after archive: `git fetch --prune` and `git branch -D <feature-branch>`
